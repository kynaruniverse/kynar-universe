# Philosophy
This tool was built on the principle that digital life should support your physical reality, not distract from it. It avoids complex automations in favour of intentional, manual entry.

# How it helps
By providing a fixed structure for your data, it removes the "blank page" anxiety of starting a new system. It focuses on core essentials: clarity, retrieval, and calm.

# Usage
Designed to be used once a day for five minutes. No notifications, no pressure to check in. It works whenever you are ready.
